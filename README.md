# Help me hire you! Tips for landing your first dev role

As a UX focused front end developer, I’m a strong believer in empathy. Understanding what others want is key to effective collaboration. In this session, I’m going to share my views on:

- What do I look for in a developer CV?
- What kind of tools can be used to assess candidates?
- How much does a technical assessment weigh on my mind?
- What am I looking for at the speed interview?
- What makes a candidate stand out to me?
- How do I approach "team fit”, and why do I avoid this term?

Hopefully, this will help you empathise with the recruiters, and find ways to help them hire you!
