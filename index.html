					<h2>We're all humans</h2>
					<p>Especially those involved in <em>recruiting</em> and <em>management</em></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Because, who am I <em>recruiting</em>? <strong>Future colleagues</strong>.</p>
						<p>And who are <em>managers</em> in charge of? <strong>People</strong></p>
						<p>When you're looking for a job, it's easy to forget, and focus on your needs.</p>
						<p>When you were unsuccessful, you wondered, what is wrong with <em>me</em>?</p>
						<p>But it's not the only reason why the employer didn't choose you.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Knowing what employers need, and ensuring both your needs are aligned, is key to a successful application.</p>
						<p>I'm a strong believer in empathy. And that's why I'm here</p>
						<p>...to tell you about how recruitment works from employer's side of things</p>
						<p>If want to become a developer, you have to like solving problems.</p>
						<p>Hopefully after this talk, you'd be able to solve problems for the employers.</p>

					<h2>How?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Ask</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Align test session with appropriate dev</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Roster devs</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Turn them into observers and/or note taker</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">Share findings with the team</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>A lot of what I taked about means double budget (dev + design) early, which pays off</p>
						<p>Some devs, especially BEDs, see no point in this. FEDs are often on board</p>
						<p>When companies first try, they make devs sit in every testing session, both user and usability test. Pointless, deminishing return</p>
						<p>Data heavy prototype, get devs to sit in first session, fix, and followup</p>
						<p>Final synthesised findings give devs idea of how decisions are reached, important to them and not</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why not simply share finding?</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">It's an investment in your developers, and the team</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Only sharing findings is like telling GoT beginning, and explain the ending</p>
						<p>A dev who see users right click, will remember to markup links correctly</p>
						<p>Small dev decisions are made without UX knowing. Database structure, allow scroll in iOS, how iframe gets put together and etc.</p>
						<p>A dev who have witness his/her take 10 seconds to load during a session, is more likely to be on board with performance projects</p>
						<p>Remind eachother of the experiences we've shared</p>

					<h2>UX is a journey</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						Best experience for developers <br>
						=<br>
						Best experience for users</p>

				<section>
					<h2>What next?</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						UXer, go talk to your devs <br>
						Devs, ask to be involved
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Homework!</p>
						<p>UXer, find a dev. Dev, find UXer. Now talk about how you'd like to work with eachother</p>
						<p>We've turned UI into UX Designers through involvement in research. Lets Devs into UX Devs too</p>
