						<p>What does recruitment process generally looks like?</p>
						<p>From my POV, there are 6 stages</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Phase 1: Preparing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Why hire an intern or junior talent?</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Which team?</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">What does that team need?</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">‚úÖ Job description/ad</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Organisation asks itself, why hire an intern or junior talent?</p>
						<p>Depending on its size, business life cycle, and values, answers can range from:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Questionable "save cost"</li>
							<li>Expanding rapidly, not enough talent in market</li>
							<li>Train into niche specialities like ecommerce and Salesforce</li>
							<li>Lofty "fostering future generation of coders"</li>
							<li>(intern) Entice them into future role with us</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This will inform job posting tones and attitudes.</p>

						<p><strong>Which team?</strong></p>
						<p>For org with multiple teams, sometimes teams can volunteer or request.</p>
						<p>Team's culture and natuer of work will inform the "What you'll learn" section from the ad.</p>

						<p><strong>Team needs</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Team is full of disgruntled old people and keen on fresh young energy</li>
							<li>Members' growth plans involve practice mentoring</li>
							<li>Team practice/refine onboarding process</li>
							<li>Team has regular/rotation spot for junior talent</li>
							<li>(intern) Temporary help to get over a feature release</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Ok, got JD, where do I advertise the role, or find candidates?</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Phase 3: Screening</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><em>Reactive</em> - Candidates apply</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"><em>Proactive</em> - Search on a platform</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><em>Both</em></li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4"><strong>Goal</strong>: 20-100 candidates per role</p>

					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">2,000 SoT profiles</p>
					<p>
						<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">1 week to screen</span> 
						<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7"> ‚âà 57 candidates / hour üò±</span>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>3 main ways</p>
						<p>Well known companies with track record will adopt a reactive strategy. Just screen from people who applied.</p>
						<p>So if you never registered interest or reached out, you won't be considered.</p>

						<p>Lesser known companies understand that if candidates don't know about them, no one would apply.</p>
						<p>So they'd actively reach out, and shortlist candidates.</p>
						
						<p>Organisations with a bit of dedicated resource (perosonnel, time, and $$) may adopt both</p>
						
						<p>What is my goal during this phase? Manageable ratio of around 20-100 per 1 role</p>

						<p>Say there are 2,000 candidates on SoT</p>
						<p>Say you're given 1 week (35hrs) to narrow down the pool for teams.</p>
						<p>If I'm a proactive type, I'll be trying to sort through 57 profiles per hour</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Screening tools</h4>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">SoT filters <br>(student status, dev, and etc.)</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">SoT completed profiles</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">CV/resume</li> 
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Portfolio or Git repos</li>
					</ul>	
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">‚úÖ Narrowed down to 20-100 candidates</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>What tools do I have at my disposal?</p>
						<p>Student status (penultimate, last year, etc) filter, filled out profiles, well written CV keyword which matched the job description/team needs, and spreadsheets.</p>

						<p>Empty or no effort profile, CV, and lack of portfolio could be deadly</p>
						<p>Due to time and resource constraints, candidates become numbers and spreadsheets</p>
						<p>After a week's of hard work, I now have a much smaller list to present to my teams</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Phase 4: Selecting</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Most <em>resource heavy</em> - Require many people's time</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
							Most <em>intense period</em> - Short, and very busy

							<ul class="nested-list">
								<li>Shortlist candidates (fine tooth comb)</li>
								<li>Technical assessment (sometimes)</li>
								<li>Interviews </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>At this point, you students have applied to 10 companies, or may have heard from a few</p>
						<p>...is waiting for a response or call for next steps, and posting nervous slack messages to eachother.</p>
						
						<p>Employer's side - things gets real</p>
						<p>Up until now, there might be only couple people working recruitment.</p>
						<p>This is where teams hosting talent gets involved</p>
						<p>From pool of candidates, filter who they want</p>

						<p>Which means, if you're late, and missed cut off period (not always annouced), you're less likely to be looked at</p>

						<p>This is also the most intense and busy period.</p>
						<p>Tricky to schedule so many people in. So be mindful of employer's time and avoid rescheduling.</p>

					</ul>

					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">‚úÖ Shortlisted 6-10 candidates</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>No longer a number's game</p>
						<p>As someone shortlisting candidates, I look for</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Articulate profile, clearly highlighting career aspirations</li>
							<li>Good attitude can't be spelled out. Don't just say I love learning, or working with people. Back it up with side project or activities?</li>
						</ul>

						<p><strong>CV/resume</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>What you said in your profile and resume match the nature of the role. Love UX but applied for data science?</li>
							<li>Done works and listed out? Great! Where is it? Portfolio, links?</li>
						</ul>

						<ul>
							<li>Portfolio isn't required, but greatly boost you</li>
							<li>Not going to look at more than 3. Ain't no body got time</li>
							<li>Knows git? Real bonus. Hard to teach at work. Show and link it.</li>
							<li>Deployed work - Bonus you know how to deploy!</li>
							<li>One very well completed and deployed GitHub project is as good as any</li>
							<li>Last year I wanted to give candidates a chance, and downloaded their github work to run locally. Some is broken and doesn't run</li>
							<li>If don't know how to deploy work but it is on GitHub? GitHub Pages is free.</li>
							<li>Work isn't web based and can't be deployed for free? Upload video of how it works. Saves me the installation</li>
						</ul>

						<ul>
							<li>You don't say you love C#, no mention of HTML CSS or JS, when applying for a front end web role. <br>No one wants to be someone's backup role</li>
							<li>Waitressed in your past life? Fab, list our human skills.</li>
							<li>Hosted events or organised functions? Tell me more. This demonstrate organisation skills</li>
							<li>Make yo-self memerable</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>At this point, I've looked at 25-100 candidates... I'm tired. Difference may be so minute</p>

					<h4>Technical assessment</h4>
					
					<div class="r-stack">
						<div class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="1">
							<p>Doesn't always happen</p>
							<p>Usually when the recruitment is higher stake or is competitive</p>
						</div>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Online (HackerRank, CodeSubmit, and etc.)</li>
							<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Take-home assessment</li>
							<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">White boarding (during interview)</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>For example, last year in one of the teams, people think having a junior may reduce productivity.</p>
						<p>So we had to test if candidate has a basic understanding of git, HTML, and CSS.</p>
						<p>For some roles, we had top 20 candidates who all have side projects, do extracurricular activities and seem to have very similar uni experience.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Online</strong></p>
						<p>I personally hate online assessment. Especially the timed pressure!</p>
						<p>But it the most efficient thing we have to filter through many candidates, so I don't put too much weight on it.</p>
						<p>Tip 1: A lot of these record answer everytime you hit run code. Use this instead of paper. It's like maths test showing thoughts process</p>
						<p>Tip 2: A lot of these tests are free for candidates. Practice away. Again, like maths class</p>

						<p><strong>Take home</strong></p>
						<p>If given take home assessment, read instructions very carefully.</p>
						<p>If possible, go above and beyond to show your prowess.</p>
						<p>For example: Got emailed question to solve. Instead of submitting by attaching folder via email, do the whole thing on Git and deploy!</p>
						<p>Use README.md file to your advantage. Explain your choices and decision if you were choosing between 2 possible methods.</p>
					
						<p><strong>White-board</strong></p>
						<p>Interviewer ask question, you answer</p>
						<p>Talk through thought process. Ask clarfying questions. Gather more data to complete work!</p>

					<h4>Interview</h4>
					
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">SoT speed interview</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Full interview</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Grad day/Open day</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p><strong>Speed interview</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Classic SoT 10mins speed interview</li>
							<li>Less time consuming for employers</li>
							<li>Most stressful for both students and employers</li>
							<li>Giving concise but complete answers</li>
							<li>How well does the candidate present themselves?</li>
							<li>What do they value most?</li>
							<li>What's their working style</li>
							<li>Why are they interested in the role?</li>
						</ul>

						<p><strong>Full interview</strong></p>
						<p>Often used for roles that will likely turn into full time, or the org's first junior role.</p>
						<p>Generally 1 or 1.5 hours</p>

						<p>For both interview types, prepare questions to ask employers about the team</p> 

						<p><strong>Grad day/Open day</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Come into office to do a bunch of activities with other candidates, Hunger Games style</li>
							<li>Assess team work</li>
							<li>Test flexibility</li>
							<li>Observe reactions/attitudes</li>

						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">Likely to have a good time</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">‚úÖ Ranked 3-6 candidates to give an offer</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Lets say I have a candidate with stellar performance in technical assessment</p>
						<p>I'd choose one who makes me want to work with them during interviews</p>
						<p>I'm hiring a team mate. </p>

						<p>As mentioned, everyone in this process are busy people. Did the candidate respect our time by being punctual?</p>
						<p>Will they need much handholding on the job? Or will they be able to pick up things as they go with minor mentorship</p>
						<p>Especially in a multicultural team, will candidate be able to work effectively with people of differing comm styles?</p>
						<p>Are they likely to respectfully/pragmatically raise issues or ask for help?</p>

						<p><strong>Ahh, the detestable 'team fit'</strong></p>
						<p>When hiring for people who are the same as us, we'll create monoculture.</p>
						<p>Very thing which resulted in discrimination and lack of diversity.</p>
						<p>No, we're looking for someone who could help shift the scale a little. But not too disruptive</p>
						<p>If the team is full of introvert, I'd be weary of adding yet another introvert, or an extreme extrovert in which could create too much conflict.</p>
						<p>Want to create healthy tension between styles that will help elevate the team.</p>

						<p><strong>What can WE offer candiate?</strong></p>
						<p>If the candidate already knows all tech stack of the team, wouldn't this be a waste of their time?</p>
						<p>Are they likely to be happy with the team, and with the company?</p>
						<p>Internship is a form of a PR activity, and investment in future reputation</p>
