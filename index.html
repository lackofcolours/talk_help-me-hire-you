					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Because, who am I <em>recruiting</em>? <strong>Future colleagues</strong>.</p>
						<p>And who are <em>managers</em> in charge of? <strong>People</strong></p>
						<p>When you're looking for a job, it's easy to forget, and focus on your needs.</p>
						<p>When you were unsuccessful, you wondered, what is wrong with <em>me</em>?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>What does recruitment process generally looks like?</p>
						<p>From my POV, there are 6 stages</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Phase 1: Preparing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Why hire an intern or junior talent?</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Which team?</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">What does that team need?</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">‚úÖ Job description/ad</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Organisation asks itself, why hire an intern or junior talent?</p>
						<p>Depending on its size, business life cycle, and values, answers can range from:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Questionable "save cost"</li>
							<li>Expanding rapidly, not enough talent in market</li>
							<li>Train into niche specialities like ecommerce and Salesforce</li>
							<li>Lofty "fostering future generation of coders"</li>
							<li>(intern) Entice them into future role with us</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This will inform job posting tones and attitudes.</p>

						<p><strong>Which team?</strong></p>
						<p>For org with multiple teams, sometimes teams can volunteer or request.</p>
						<p>Team's culture and natuer of work will inform the "What you'll learn" section from the ad.</p>

						<p><strong>Team needs</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Team is full of disgruntled old people and keen on fresh young energy</li>
							<li>Members' growth plans involve practice mentoring</li>
							<li>Team practice/refine onboarding process</li>
							<li>Team has regular/rotation spot for junior talent</li>
							<li>(intern) Temporary help to get over a feature release</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Informs "What you'll do" section</p>

					<h3>Phase 2: Sourcing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">‚ù§Ô∏è Summer of Tech platform</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Trademe/Seek</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">On campus career fairs</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Employee referral</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">‚úÖ Where to find candidates</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Ok, got JD, where do I advertise the role, or find candidates?</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Phase 3: Screening</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><em>Reactive</em> - Candidates apply</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"><em>Proactive</em> - Search on a platform</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><em>Both</em></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">2,000+ profiles</span> 
						<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5"> (~57profiles/hour)</span>
						<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6"> => 25-100 per role</span>
					</p>	
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">Use SoT filters, profiles, CV, and portfolio</p>	
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">‚úÖ Narrowed pool of candidates</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>3 main ways</p>
						<p>Well known companies with track record will adopt a reactive strategy. Just screen from people who applied.</p>
						<p>So if you never registered interest or reached out, you won't be considered.</p>

						<p>Lesser known companies understand that if candidates don't know about them, no one would apply.</p>
						<p>So they'd actively reach out, and shortlist candidates.</p>
						
						<p>Organisations with a bit of dedicated resource (perosonnel, time, and $$) may adopt both</p>
						
						<p>Say there are 2,000+ candidates on SoT</p>
						<p>Say you're given 1 week (35hrs) to narrow down the pool for teams.</p>
						<p>If I'm a proactive type, I'll be trying to sort through 57 profiles per hour</p>
						<p>Which I'll narrow down manageable ratio of around 25-100:1 role</p>

						<p>What helps me decide?</p>
						<p>Student status (penultimate, last year, etc) filter, filled out profiles, well written CV keyword which matched the job description/team needs, and spreadsheets.</p>

						<p>Empty or no effort profile, CV, and lack of portfolio could be deadly</p>
						<p>Due to time and resource constraints, candidates become numbers and spreadsheets</p>
						<p>After a week's of hard work, I now have a much smaller list to present to my teams</p>

					<h3>Phase 4: Selecting</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Most <em>resource heavy</em> - Team activity</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
							Most <em>intense period</em> - Short, and very busy

							<ul class="nested-list">

								<li>Technical assessment (optional)</li>

						<p>At this point, you students have applied to 10 companies</p>
						<p>... is waiting for a response, and posting nervous slack messages to eachother.</p>
						<p>Up until now, there might be only couple people working recruitment.</p>
						<p>This is where teams hosting talent gets involved</p>
						<p>Recruitment actually is a team activity.</p>
						<p>From pool of candidates, filter who they want</p>
						<p>Which means, if you're late, and missed cut off period (not always annouced), you're less likely to be looked at</p>

						<p>This is also the most intense and busy period.</p>
